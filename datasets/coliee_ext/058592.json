            "Crime_Type": "Property Crimes",
            "Legal_Issue": "Does the Immigration Division have jurisdiction to proceed with an inadmissibility hearing when a request for Ministerial relief under s. 34(2) is pending?",
            "Governing_Law": "Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)",
            "Legal_Provision": "s. 34(1)",
            "Legal_Provision_Cited": "IRPA s. 34(1)(f)",
            "Legal_Rule": "Under IRPA, s. 34(1) determines inadmissibility on security grounds, while s. 34(2) allows the Minister to exempt individuals if their presence does not harm national interest. No explicit requirement exists for s. 34(2) to precede s. 34(1).",
            "Application": "The applicant argued that the Board lacked jurisdiction to hold an inadmissibility hearing until the Minister decided on relief. However, the Court found no statutory requirement for the Minister's decision to precede the Board's determination.",

            "Procedure": "The applicant sought judicial review, arguing the Board lacked jurisdiction. The Federal Court analyzed the relationship between s. 34(1) and s. 34(2) and dismissed the application.",
